Our group decided to go to Berlin.

We drove a BMW to get Gebaeck.


After he ate all the gebaecks, all he wanted to do is sit in front of the klimaanlage.
So we couldn't get any gebaecks because of him, the lead singer of Rammstein, the Lindemann.
We took our Hund to the Biergarten for some Bratwurst.


In our way we saw a bakery, there was an amazing apple cake smell
I wish they had more klimaanlage because it's so hot.
We flipped a 180 and almost took out several women in dirndels.
